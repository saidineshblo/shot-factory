# Replicate TypeScript MCP Server# Replicate MCP server

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic that defines how applications share context with large language models (LLMs).

MCP lets you give natural language instructions to a language model, and it can discover and run APIs automatically on your behalf.

This an npm package that bundles up an MCP server for Replicate's HTTP API so you can run Replicate API commands using prompts like these:

> Search Replicate for upscaler models and compare them

> Show me the latest Replicate models created by @fofr

> Generate an image using black-forest-labs/flux-schnell

> Upscale that image using the best upscaler model

To get started, see the following guides:

- [Using Replicate MCP with Claude Desktop](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/mcp#using-replicate-mcp-with-claude-desktop)
- [Using Replicate MCP with Cursor](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/mcp#using-replicate-mcp-with-cursor)
- [Using Replicate MCP with GitHub Copilot in VS Code](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/mcp#using-replicate-mcp-with-github-copilot-in-vs-code)

---

## Installation

### Direct invocation

You can run the MCP server directly via `npx`.

Create a Replicate API token at [replicate.com/account/api-tokens](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens?new-token-name=mcp-server), then run:

```sh
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="My Bearer Token"
npx -y replicate-mcp@latest
```

### Via MCP Client

There is a partial list of existing clients at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients). If you already
have a client, consult their documentation to install the MCP server.

For clients with a configuration JSON, it might look something like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "replicate": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "replicate-mcp", "--client=claude", "--tools=dynamic"],
      "env": {
        "REPLICATE_API_TOKEN": "My Bearer Token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Exposing endpoints to your MCP Client

There are two ways to expose endpoints as tools in the MCP server:

1. Exposing one tool per endpoint, and filtering as necessary
2. Exposing a set of tools to dynamically discover and invoke endpoints from the API

### Filtering endpoints and tools

You can run the package on the command line to discover and filter the set of tools that are exposed by the
MCP Server. This can be helpful for large APIs where including all endpoints at once is too much for your AI's
context window.

You can filter by multiple aspects:

- `--tool` includes a specific tool by name
- `--resource` includes all tools under a specific resource, and can have wildcards, e.g. `my.resource*`
- `--operation` includes just read (get/list) or just write operations

### Dynamic tools

If you specify `--tools=dynamic` to the MCP server, instead of exposing one tool per endpoint in the API, it will
expose the following tools:

1. `list_api_endpoints` - Discovers available endpoints, with optional filtering by search query
2. `get_api_endpoint_schema` - Gets detailed schema information for a specific endpoint
3. `invoke_api_endpoint` - Executes any endpoint with the appropriate parameters

This allows you to have the full set of API endpoints available to your MCP Client, while not requiring that all
of their schemas be loaded into context at once. Instead, the LLM will automatically use these tools together to
search for, look up, and invoke endpoints dynamically. However, due to the indirect nature of the schemas, it
can struggle to provide the correct properties a bit more than when tools are imported explicitly. Therefore,
you can opt-in to explicit tools, the dynamic tools, or both.

See more information with `--help`.

All of these command-line options can be repeated, combined together, and have corresponding exclusion versions (e.g. `--no-tool`).

Use `--list` to see the list of available tools, or see below.

### Specifying the MCP Client

Different clients have varying abilities to handle arbitrary tools and schemas.

You can specify the client you are using with the `--client` argument, and the MCP server will automatically
serve tools and schemas that are more compatible with that client.

- `--client=<type>`: Set all capabilities based on a known MCP client

  - Valid values: `openai-agents`, `claude`, `claude-code`, `cursor`
  - Example: `--client=cursor`

Additionally, if you have a client not on the above list, or the client has gotten better
over time, you can manually enable or disable certain capabilities:

- `--capability=<name>`: Specify individual client capabilities
  - Available capabilities:
    - `top-level-unions`: Enable support for top-level unions in tool schemas
    - `valid-json`: Enable JSON string parsing for arguments
    - `refs`: Enable support for $ref pointers in schemas
    - `unions`: Enable support for union types (anyOf) in schemas
    - `formats`: Enable support for format validations in schemas (e.g. date-time, email)
    - `tool-name-length=N`: Set maximum tool name length to N characters
  - Example: `--capability=top-level-unions --capability=tool-name-length=40`
  - Example: `--capability=top-level-unions,tool-name-length=40`

### Examples

1. Filter for read operations on cards:

```bash
--resource=cards --operation=read
```

2. Exclude specific tools while including others:

```bash
--resource=cards --no-tool=create_cards
```

3. Configure for Cursor client with custom max tool name length:

```bash
--client=cursor --capability=tool-name-length=40
```

4. Complex filtering with multiple criteria:

```bash
--resource=cards,accounts --operation=read --tag=kyc --no-tool=create_cards
```

## Importing the tools and server individually

```js
// Import the server, generated endpoints, or the init function
import { server, endpoints, init } from "replicate-mcp/server";

// import a specific tool
import listCollections from "replicate-mcp/tools/collections/list-collections";

// initialize the server and all endpoints
init({ server, endpoints });

// manually start server
const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);

// or initialize your own server with specific tools
const myServer = new McpServer(...);

// define your own endpoint
const myCustomEndpoint = {
  tool: {
    name: 'my_custom_tool',
    description: 'My custom tool',
    inputSchema: zodToJsonSchema(z.object({ a_property: z.string() })),
  },
  handler: async (client: replicate, args: any) => {
    return { myResponse: 'Hello world!' };
  })
};

// initialize the server with your custom endpoints
init({ server: myServer, endpoints: [listCollections, myCustomEndpoint] });
```

    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    https://api.replicate.com/v1/deployments/acme/my-app-image-generator/predictions
  ```

  The request will wait up to 60 seconds for the model to run. If this time is exceeded the prediction will be returned in a `"starting"` state and need to be retrieved using the `predictions.get` endpiont.

  For a complete overview of the `deployments.predictions.create` API check out our documentation on [creating a prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction) which covers a variety of use cases.

### Resource `hardware`:

- `list_hardware` (`read`): Example cURL request:

  Note that there is a limit of 1,000 models per account. For most purposes, we recommend using a single model and pushing new [versions](https://replicate.com/docs/how-does-replicate-work#versions) of the model as you make changes to it.

- `list_models` (`read`): Get a paginated list of public models.

  Example cURL request:

  ```console
  curl -s \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
    https://api.replicate.com/v1/models
  ```

  The response will be a pagination object containing a list of model objects.

  See the [`models.get`](#models.get) docs for more details about the model object.

- `delete_models` (`write`): Delete a model

  Model deletion has some restrictions:

  - You can only delete models you own.
  - You can only delete private models.
  - You can only delete models that have no versions associated with them. Currently you'll need to [delete the model's versions](#models.versions.delete) before you can delete the model itself.

  Example cURL request:

  ```command
  curl -s -X DELETE \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
    https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/replicate/hello-world
  ```

  The response will be an empty 204, indicating the model has been deleted.

- `get_models` (`read`): Example cURL request:

  ```console
  curl -s \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
    https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/replicate/hello-world
  ```

  The response will be a model object in the following format:

  ```json
  {
    "url": "https://replicate.com/replicate/hello-world",
    "owner": "replicate",
    "name": "hello-world",
    "description": "A tiny model that says hello",
    "visibility": "public",
    "github_url": "https://github.com/replicate/cog-examples",
    "paper_url": null,
    "license_url": null,
    "run_count": 5681081,
    "cover_image_url": "...",
    "default_example": {...},
    "latest_version": {...},
  }
  ```

  The model object includes the [input and output schema](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/openapi#model-schemas) for the latest version of the model.

  Here's an example showing how to fetch the model with cURL and display its input schema with [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/):

  ```console
  curl -s \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
      https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/replicate/hello-world \
      | jq ".latest_version.openapi_schema.components.schemas.Input"
  ```

  This will return the following JSON object:

  ```json
  {
    "type": "object",
    "title": "Input",
    "required": ["text"],
    "properties": {
      "text": {
        "type": "string",
        "title": "Text",
        "x-order": 0,
        "description": "Text to prefix with 'hello '"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  The `cover_image_url` string is an HTTPS URL for an image file. This can be:

  - An image uploaded by the model author.
  - The output file of the example prediction, if the model author has not set a cover image.
  - The input file of the example prediction, if the model author has not set a cover image and the example prediction has no output file.
  - A generic fallback image.

  The `default_example` object is a [prediction](#predictions.get) created with this model.

  The `latest_version` object is the model's most recently pushed [version](#models.versions.get).

- `search_models` (`write`): Get a list of public models matching a search query.

  Example cURL request:

  ```console
  curl -s -X QUERY \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
    -d "hello" \
    https://api.replicate.com/v1/models
  ```

  The response will be a paginated JSON object containing an array of model objects.

  See the [`models.get`](#models.get) docs for more details about the model object.

### Resource `models.examples`:

- `list_models_examples` (`read`): List [example predictions](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/models/publish-a-model#what-are-examples) made using the model.
  These are predictions that were saved by the model author as illustrative examples of the model's capabilities.

  If you want all the examples for a model, use this operation.

  If you just want the model's default example, you can use the [`models.get`](#models.get) operation instead, which includes a `default_example` object.

  Example cURL request:

  ```console
  curl -s \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
    https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/replicate/hello-world/examples
  ```

  The response will be a pagination object containing a list of example predictions:

  ```json
  {
    "next": "https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/replicate/hello-world/examples?cursor=...",
    "previous": "https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/replicate/hello-world/examples?cursor=...",
    "results": [...]
  }
  ```

  Each item in the `results` list is a [prediction object](#predictions.get).

### Resource `models.predictions`:

- `create_models_predictions` (`write`): Create a prediction using an [official model](https://replicate.com/changelog/2025-01-29-official-models).

  If you're _not_ running an official model, use the [`predictions.create`](#predictions.create) operation instead.

  Example cURL request:

  ```console
  curl -s -X POST -H 'Prefer: wait' \
    -d '{"input": {"prompt": "Write a short poem about the weather."}}' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/meta/meta-llama-3-70b-instruct/predictions
  ```

  The request will wait up to 60 seconds for the model to run. If this time is exceeded the prediction will be returned in a `"starting"` state and need to be retrieved using the `predictions.get` endpiont.

  For a complete overview of the `deployments.predictions.create` API check out our documentation on [creating a prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction) which covers a variety of use cases.

  ```
  # Hello World Model

  This is an example model that...
  ```

### Resource `models.versions`:

- `list_models_versions` (`read`): Example cURL request:

  ```console
  curl -s \

  ```

  The response will be a JSON array of model version objects, sorted with the most recent version first:

  ```json
  {
    "next": null,
    "previous": null,
    "results": [
      {
        "id": "5c7d5dc6dd8bf75c1acaa8565735e7986bc5b66206b55cca93cb72c9bf15ccaa",

      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- `delete_models_versions` (`write`): Delete a model version and all associated predictions, including all output files.

  Model version deletion has some restrictions:

  - You can only delete versions from models you own.
  - You can only delete versions from private models.
  - You cannot delete a version if someone other than you has run predictions with it.
  - You cannot delete a version if it is being used as the base model for a fine tune/training.
  - You cannot delete a version if it has an associated deployment.
  - You cannot delete a version if another model version is overridden to use it.

  Example cURL request:

  ```command
  curl -s -X DELETE \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
    https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/replicate/hello-world/versions/5c7d5dc6dd8bf75c1acaa8565735e7986bc5b66206b55cca93cb72c9bf15ccaa
  ```

  The response will be an empty 202, indicating the deletion request has been accepted. It might take a few minutes to be processed.

- `get_models_versions` (`read`): Example cURL request:

  ```console
  curl -s \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
    https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/replicate/hello-world/versions/5c7d5dc6dd8bf75c1acaa8565735e7986bc5b66206b55cca93cb72c9bf15ccaa
  ```

  The response will be the version object:

  ```json
  {
    "id": "5c7d5dc6dd8bf75c1acaa8565735e7986bc5b66206b55cca93cb72c9bf15ccaa",
    "created_at": "2022-04-26T19:29:04.418669Z",
    "cog_version": "0.3.0",
    "openapi_schema": {...}
  }
  ```

  Every model describes its inputs and outputs with [OpenAPI Schema Objects](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html#schemaObject) in the `openapi_schema` property.

  The `openapi_schema.components.schemas.Input` property for the [replicate/hello-world](https://replicate.com/replicate/hello-world) model looks like this:

  ```json
  {
    "type": "object",
    "title": "Input",
    "required": ["text"],
    "properties": {
      "text": {
        "x-order": 0,
        "type": "string",
        "title": "Text",
        "description": "Text to prefix with 'hello '"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  The `openapi_schema.components.schemas.Output` property for the [replicate/hello-world](https://replicate.com/replicate/hello-world) model looks like this:

  ```json
  {
    "type": "string",
    "title": "Output"
  }
  ```

  For more details, see the docs on [Cog's supported input and output types](https://github.com/replicate/cog/blob/75b7802219e7cd4cee845e34c4c22139558615d4/docs/python.md#input-and-output-types)

### Resource `predictions`:

- `create_predictions` (`write`): Create a prediction for the model version and inputs you provide.

  If you're running an [official model](https://replicate.com/collections/official), use the [`models.predictions.create`](#models.predictions.create) operation instead.

  Example cURL request:

  ```console
  curl -s -X POST -H 'Prefer: wait' \
    -d '{"version": "replicate/hello-world:5c7d5dc6dd8bf75c1acaa8565735e7986bc5b66206b55cca93cb72c9bf15ccaa", "input": {"text": "Alice"}}' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions
  ```

  The request will wait up to 60 seconds for the model to run. If this time is exceeded the prediction will be returned in a `"starting"` state and need to be retrieved using the `predictions.get` endpiont.

  For a complete overview of the `predictions.create` API check out our documentation on [creating a prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction) which covers a variety of use cases.

- `list_predictions` (`read`): Get a paginated list of all predictions created by the user or organization associated with the provided API token.

  This will include predictions created from the API and the website. It will return 100 records per page.

  Example cURL request:

  ```console
  curl -s \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
    https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions
  ```

  The response will be a paginated JSON array of prediction objects, sorted with the most recent prediction first:

  ```json
  {
    "next": null,
    "previous": null,
    "results": [
      {
        "completed_at": "2023-09-08T16:19:34.791859Z",
        "created_at": "2023-09-08T16:19:34.907244Z",

      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  `id` will be the unique ID of the prediction.

  `source` will indicate how the prediction was created. Possible values are `web` or `api`.

  `status` will be the status of the prediction. Refer to [get a single prediction](#predictions.get) for possible values.

  `urls` will be a convenience object that can be used to construct new API requests for the given prediction. If the requested model version supports streaming, this will have a `stream` entry with an HTTPS URL that you can use to construct an [`EventSource`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource).

  `model` will be the model identifier string in the format of `{model_owner}/{model_name}`.

  `version` will be the unique ID of model version used to create the prediction.

  `data_removed` will be `true` if the input and output data has been deleted.

- `cancel_predictions` (`write`): Cancel a prediction that is currently running.

  Example cURL request that creates a prediction and then cancels it:

  ```console
  # First, create a prediction
  PREDICTION_ID=$(curl -s -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "input": {
        "prompt": "a video that may take a while to generate"
      }
    }' \
    https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/minimax/video-01/predictions | jq -r '.id')

  # Echo the prediction ID
  echo "Created prediction with ID: $PREDICTION_ID"

  # Cancel the prediction
  curl -s -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
    https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions/$PREDICTION_ID/cancel
  ```

- `get_predictions` (`read`): Get the current state of a prediction.

  Example cURL request:

  ```console
  curl -s \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
    https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions/gm3qorzdhgbfurvjtvhg6dckhu
  ```

  The response will be the prediction object:

  ```json
  {
    "id": "gm3qorzdhgbfurvjtvhg6dckhu",
    "model": "replicate/hello-world",
    "version": "5c7d5dc6dd8bf75c1acaa8565735e7986bc5b66206b55cca93cb72c9bf15ccaa",
    "input": {
      "text": "Alice"
    },
    "logs": "",
    "output": "hello Alice",
    "error": null,
    "status": "succeeded",
    "created_at": "2023-09-08T16:19:34.765994Z",
    "data_removed": false,
    "started_at": "2023-09-08T16:19:34.779176Z",
    "completed_at": "2023-09-08T16:19:34.791859Z",
    "metrics": {
      "predict_time": 0.012683
    },
    "urls": {
      "web": "https://replicate.com/p/gm3qorzdhgbfurvjtvhg6dckhu",
      "get": "https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions/gm3qorzdhgbfurvjtvhg6dckhu",
      "cancel": "https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions/gm3qorzdhgbfurvjtvhg6dckhu/cancel"
    }
  }
  ```

  `status` will be one of:

  - `starting`: the prediction is starting up. If this status lasts longer than a few seconds, then it's typically because a new worker is being started to run the prediction.
  - `processing`: the `predict()` method of the model is currently running.
  - `succeeded`: the prediction completed successfully.
  - `failed`: the prediction encountered an error during processing.
  - `canceled`: the prediction was canceled by its creator.

  In the case of success, `output` will be an object containing the output of the model. Any files will be represented as HTTPS URLs. You'll need to pass the `Authorization` header to request them.

  In the case of failure, `error` will contain the error encountered during the prediction.

  Terminated predictions (with a status of `succeeded`, `failed`, or `canceled`) will include a `metrics` object with a `predict_time` property showing the amount of CPU or GPU time, in seconds, that the prediction used while running. It won't include time waiting for the prediction to start.

  All input parameters, output values, and logs are automatically removed after an hour, by default, for predictions created through the API.

  You must save a copy of any data or files in the output if you'd like to continue using them. The `output` key will still be present, but it's value will be `null` after the output has been removed.

  Output files are served by `replicate.delivery` and its subdomains. If you use an allow list of external domains for your assets, add `replicate.delivery` and `*.replicate.delivery` to it.

### Resource `trainings`:

- `create_trainings` (`write`): Start a new training of the model version you specify.

  Example request body:

  ```json
  {
    "destination": "{new_owner}/{new_name}",
    "input": {
      "train_data": "https://example.com/my-input-images.zip"
    },
    "webhook": "https://example.com/my-webhook"
  }
  ```

  Example cURL request:

  ```console
  curl -s -X POST \
    -d '{"destination": "{new_owner}/{new_name}", "input": {"input_images": "https://example.com/my-input-images.zip"}}' \

      "cancel": "https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions/zz4ibbonubfz7carwiefibzgga/cancel"
    }
  }
  ```

  As models can take several minutes or more to train, the result will not be available immediately. To get the final result of the training you should either provide a `webhook` HTTPS URL for us to call when the results are ready, or poll the [get a training](#trainings.get) endpoint until it has finished.

  When a training completes, it creates a new [version](https://replicate.com/docs/how-does-replicate-work#terminology) of the model at the specified destination.

  To find some models to train on, check out the [trainable language models collection](https://replicate.com/collections/trainable-language-models).
